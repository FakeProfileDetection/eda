hello world.  I am typing and attempting to avoid mistakes such as typing two keys at once...let's be honest, this happens from time to time.  However, with practice, I could improve my typing.  It's not likely to happen because autocorrect takes care of all that for me, making it somewhat of a non-issue.  Although, I tend to waste a lot of time correcting typos.  So, maybe I should practice more.
